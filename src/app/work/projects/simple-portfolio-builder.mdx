## Overview

‘Glow by Ugosylvia’ is a sophisticated web platform designed for a beauty and cosmetics brand, offering both e‑commerce capabilities for product sales and an integrated system for booking beauty services. The project aimed to provide a seamless user experience for customers and robust management tools for the business. I single‑handedly built the entire platform as a solo fullstack developer.

## Key Features

- **E‑commerce Storefront**: Developed the customer‑facing shop with product browsing by category, detailed product pages, shopping cart, secure checkout, user accounts, order history, and wishlists.
- **Service Booking System**: Built functionality for clients to book signature beauty services (e.g., Microblading, Ombre Brows), view service details, and manage appointments via a user dashboard.
- **Comprehensive Admin Dashboard**: Created a backend panel featuring:

  - **Analytics**: Visualized metrics like total revenue, appointments, new clients, and revenue breakdowns using Recharts.
  - **Product & Category Management**: Full CRUD operations for products and categories.
  - **Order Management**: Tracking and fulfillment of product orders.
  - **Appointment Management**: Scheduling and managing client service bookings.
  - **Client Management**: Maintaining a customer database.
  - **Messaging System**: Direct email communication with clients using Tiptap‑based editor and Resend integration.

- **User Authentication & Authorization**: Implemented secure registration, login, and session management for both customers and administrators using Supabase Auth.
- **Payment Integration**: Integrated Paystack to handle online payments for products and service deposits.
- **UI/UX & PWA Enablement**: Crafted a responsive, mobile‑first interface using Next.js (v15), React (v19), TypeScript, Tailwind CSS (v4), Radix UI components, and enabled PWA capabilities with `next-pwa`. Implemented dark/light mode using `next-themes`.
- **Loyalty Program**: Developed loyalty logic allowing users to earn and redeem rewards through platform activity.

## Technologies Used

- **Next.js (v15)**: React framework for SSR, SSG, and API routes.
- **React (v19) & TypeScript**: Core frontend libraries for component development and type safety.
- **Tailwind CSS (v4) & Radix UI**: Utility‑first CSS and component library for consistent styling.
- **Zustand**: State management for client‑side data.
- **React Hook Form & Zod**: Form handling and schema‑based validation.
- **Supabase**: PostgreSQL database, authentication, and real‑time features.
- **Paystack**: Payment gateway for secure Naira transactions.
- **Resend**: Email service for transactional messaging.
- **Tiptap**: Rich text editor used in admin messaging and content management.
- **Embla Carousel**: Responsive carousels for product and service showcases.
- **Recharts**: Data visualization library for admin analytics dashboards.
- **next-pwa**: PWA support to enable offline access and installable web app.
- **Utilities**: `date-fns`, `slugify`, `sharp` for image processing.
- **Version Control**: Git.

## Challenges and Learnings

- **Integrating Diverse Functionalities**: Combining e‑commerce, service booking, loyalty program, and an extensive admin panel into a cohesive platform required careful data modeling and architecture planning.
- **Feature-Rich Admin Panel**: Building an admin dashboard with detailed analytics, multiple management modules (products, orders, appointments, clients), and a messaging system enhanced my skills in backend design and complex UI workflows.
- **Responsive and PWA Design**: Ensuring seamless experience across desktop and mobile, while implementing offline capabilities through PWA, demanded rigorous testing and optimization.
- **Third‑Party Service Integrations**: Coordinating Paystack, Resend, and Supabase, while maintaining security and reliability, taught me effective API error handling and secure token management.
- **Real‑time Data Considerations**: Leveraging Supabase’s real‑time features for appointment availability and order status updates required careful synchronization to prevent data conflicts.

## Outcome

The ‘Glow by Ugosylvia’ platform launched successfully, providing a modern, robust online presence that seamlessly integrates product sales and service bookings. The application empowers the business with efficient management tools and offers customers an engaging, convenient experience. My contributions as a mid‑level fullstack developer were critical in delivering a feature-complete, polished application, further advancing my expertise in building complex, real‑world web solutions for the beauty and retail industry.
