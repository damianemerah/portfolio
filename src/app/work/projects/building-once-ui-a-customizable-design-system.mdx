## Overview

Acc‑Gen is a web platform designed to be Nigeria’s trusted hub for digital services. It offers instant SMS verification, social media boosting orders, and a marketplace for premium digital accounts, all billed in Naira using local payment methods. This two‑person fullstack team built the application from conception to deployment, where I served as a mid‑level developer.

## Key Features

- **Dashboard & User Management**: Developed a responsive dashboard displaying user balances, referral statistics, active orders, and transaction history. Integrated Supabase Auth for secure registration, login, session handling, and profile updates.
- **SMS Verification & Social Boost Orders**: Implemented backend workflows to request SMS codes via third‑party APIs and built a UI for scheduling social boosting campaigns. Handled order creation, status tracking, and real‑time updates through Supabase’s real‑time services.
- **Digital Accounts Marketplace**: Created a listing system for premium accounts with filtering and search, coupled with order processing logic using Next.js API routes and Supabase. Ensured secure handling of digital goods and user access control.
- **Payment Integration**: Integrated Paystack and KoraPay to enable seamless Naira deposits, wallet management, and withdrawal requests. Built a secure transaction flow with hCaptcha protection and robust error handling.
- **Referral Program**: Designed and implemented a referral system that generates unique codes and links, tracks referred sign‑ups, calculates commissions, and displays earnings in the user dashboard. Provided withdrawal functionality for accumulated referral earnings.
- **UI/UX & Theming**: Utilized Next.js, React, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, and shadcn/ui to create a clean, accessible interface. Implemented dark/light mode toggling and responsive design across dashboard components.
- **State Management & Data Fetching**: Employed Zustand for efficient client‑side state management and SWR for data fetching, caching, and revalidation, ensuring a smooth and reactive user experience.

## Technologies Used

- **Next.js**: React framework for server‑side rendering and API routes.
- **React & TypeScript**: Core frontend libraries for component development and type safety.
- **Tailwind CSS & shadcn/ui**: Utility‑first CSS framework and Radix‑based component library for styling.
- **Zustand**: Lightweight state management for global client‑side data.
- **react‑hook‑form & Zod**: Form handling and schema‑based validation.
- **Supabase**: PostgreSQL database, authentication, and real‑time services.
- **Paystack & KoraPay**: Payment gateways for Naira transactions.
- **hCaptcha**: Bot protection for critical forms.
- **SWR**: Data fetching and caching library.
- **Git & Vercel**: Version control and deployment platform.

## Challenges and Learnings

- **Third‑Party Integrations**: Coordinating Supabase, two payment gateways, SMS APIs, and social‑boosting services required careful orchestration of endpoints, error handling, and security measures.
- **Security & Data Integrity**: Ensuring safe handling of user credentials and financial data demanded implementation of best practices—JWT tokens, secure Supabase policies, and input sanitization.
- **Complex Dashboard Layout**: Designing a dashboard that surfaces varied information—balances, referrals, orders—without clutter posed UI/UX challenges. The solution involved modular components, clear typography, and adaptive layouts.
- **Small Team Collaboration**: In a two‑developer setup, maintaining code hygiene, consistent naming conventions, and clear Git branching strategies was essential. Pair programming and frequent code reviews streamlined development.
- **Local Market Considerations**: Adapting to Nigeria‑specific requirements—Naira pricing, local payment workflows, hCaptcha for bot protection—offered insights into regional user behaviors and regulatory factors.

## Outcome

Acc‑Gen launched successfully as a secure, user‑friendly platform for digital services in Nigeria. The application offers a modern interface, seamless Naira payment processing, and a comprehensive referral program. My contributions as a mid‑level fullstack developer were instrumental in delivering core functionalities and ensuring a cohesive user experience. This project reinforced my expertise in Next.js, Supabase, and full‑stack integrations in a production environment.
